NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::patch::https_hard_timeout - Patch module for
    LWP::UserAgent

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::UserAgent::patch::https_hard_timeout -timeout => 300;

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains a simple workaround for hanging issue with HTTPS
    requests. It wraps send_request() with an alarm() timeout.

FAQ
  Why not subclass?
    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP::UserAgent (or WWW::Mechanize, and so on).
